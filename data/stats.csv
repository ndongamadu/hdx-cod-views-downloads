The process of preparing census enumeration area maps began in June 2012. Township Immigration Officers who prepared these maps were trained on the objectives of the census, the roles of maps in the census process, concepts of sketching maps at township and ward/village tract level, and plotting new landmark features on the maps. Topographical sheets that make up the entire country were collated and maps of each of the 330 townships printed and distributed to the respective field offices. In total, there were an estimated 81,750 enumeration areas covering almost the entire country.  Some parts of the country could not be mapped due to security reasons.
The data in this file is drawn from the provisional results as made available in the Population and Housing Census of Myanmar, 2014 – Provisional Results produced by the Department of Population. This report is the first in a series of publications to be released from the 2014 Myanmar Census.
The provisional results indicate that the population of Myanmar on the night of 29th March 2014 (Census Night) was 51,419,420 persons. This information will be used as a provisional figure until the main results are released.

The total population of the country in 1395 is estimated to be around 29.1 million, which is inclusive of the 1.5 million nomadic population.

This dataset format was created on 15 August 2016 by the Information Management Unit (IMU) of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Afghanistan. Since the Afghanistan Geodesy and Cartography Head Office (AGCHO) is recognized as the sole authoritative source a for administrative boundaries, the population estimates have also been matched to the administrative names and codes of the AGCHO dataset. The dataset include popluation estimates disaggregated by CSO province and district codes (including Kabul city districts), population estimates disaggreated by AGCHO district codes, and a lookup table that relates CSO, AGCHO and AIMS legacy codes. Note that the 1.5 million nomadic population is NOT included in the province and district population estimates. Estimated population disaggregated by age group and gender is calculated using proportion of the total estimated population falling under each cohort based on 2011/2012 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) report. This data is only available at the province level.
